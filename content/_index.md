👋 Hi, my name is Hyoungjoo Jin and I am a software engineer.

I've always wanted to have a single, comprehensive knowledge base to store and easily access everything that I've learned throughout my life.
Instead of having scattered notes across multiple blog posts, I thought that making a central repository would be a more effective way
to organize my learnings, even though it presents more challenges.

This blog/[repository](https://github.com/hyoungjoojin/notes) is my attempt to create an encyclopedic collection of personal notes,
covering a wide range of topics and my personal experiences/thoughts.
My goal is to continuously update and expand this repository as I grow and discover new things.

This project is mostly for my personal use, but I figured this type of knowledge base could be useful for others as well,
so I've made this repository public.
I do hope that others can find meaningful information here, but please note that this is not intended to be a definitive source of information
since it may contain inaccurate/outdated information with a lot of missing pieces and my personal biases.
