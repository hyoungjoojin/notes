## Problem

We have $n$ ropes that can each hold up to $a_i$ weight. If we use multiple ropes, the weight will
be distributed across ropes. Find the maximum weight that can be held by selecting a subset of the
ropes.

## Solution

### Greedy

> Implementation: [C++](./src/a.cpp) (16ms, 2412KB) \
> Time: $O(n)$, Space: $O(1)$
