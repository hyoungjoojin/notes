# LCS

> Level: Gold 5

## Problem

Given two strings, find the length of their longest common subsequence (LCS).

## Solution

### Dynamic Programming

> Implementation: [C++](./src/a.cpp) (4ms, 6004KB) \
> Time: $O(nm)$, Space: $O(nm)$

We can use a 2-dimensional dynamic programming approach to solve this problem.
