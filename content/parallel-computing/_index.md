# Parallel Computing

## GPUs

GPUs were originally designed for graphics workloads, especially as shader programs which are simple programs that
run on every pixel of the screen.
As people wrote shader programs to do general purpose computing on graphics hardware, Nvidia created GPU compute mode
which allowed users to write general purpose SPMD programs that run on the GPU using a language called CUDA.

- [CUDA](./cuda)
