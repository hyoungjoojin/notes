# Java Lambda Expressions

Lambda expressions are anonymous functions used to implement functional interfaces.
Lambda expressions can only be used with functional interfaces.

A functional interface is an interface with a single abstract method.
`Runnable`, `Comparator`, `Function`, and `Predicate` are some examples of functional interfaces in the Java standard library.
Custom functional interfaces can be created using the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation.
